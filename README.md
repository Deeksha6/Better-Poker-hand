# Better-Poker-hand
Given two hands (each hand having 5 cards), this code finds the better poker hand among the two.

Each card has a suit and a rank.

Different predicates are used for different sets as per the poker game rules(the predicate names are same as the sets mentioned in the rules). They are :
  has_flush()
  has_full_house()
  has_straight()
  one_pair()
  two_pairs()
  three_of_a_kind()
  four_of_a_kind()
  straight_flush()
The predicate type_of_list() is used to assign a number to each of the sets as per the poker game rules.
The predicate same_rank is used to check if 2 cards are of same rank.
The predicate sort_l() and sort_p() are used to sort the cards based on the suits.
The predicate compare_type() is used to compare the types of sets in both hands.
